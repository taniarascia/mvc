## Purpose

Learn the MVC pattern by building a small app!

- **Model** - manages the data of an application
- **View** - a visual representation of the model
- **Controller** - links the user and the system

This application consists of `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`. This means that there are no frameworks or dependencies getting in the way of learning the MVC concept.
